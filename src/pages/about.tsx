      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>Hi There, I am Marcos Aur√©lio.</p>

      <p>
        I am Software engineer who like to create operational and attractive
        applications that enhance user experience. With a keen eye for design, I
        strive to deliver high-quality products with great code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the course of my career, I have worked on a range of projects, from
        small-scale applications to large-scale enterprise systems. Through
        these experiences, I have honed my skills in Nodejs, Nextjs, Reactjs,
        JavaScript, TypeScript, and unit testing, all while working in agile
        environments. As a team player, I thrive under pressure and I am able to
        prioritize tasks and meet deadlines effectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking ahead, I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge and am
        eager to explore new technologies, such as artificial intelligence. The
        concept of creating programs that can autonomously solve problems is
        nothing short of magical to me, and I am eager to learn more about this
        exciting field.
