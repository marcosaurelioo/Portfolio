        <p className={hubballiTypography.className}>
          A Software Enthusiast, I am a Brazilian self-taught Software Engineer
          who likes to create operational and attractive applications. Involved
          with computers since I was a child, I wrote my first algorithm when I
          was 16 years old, and since then I have been working on creating
          solutions with code. The motivation behind the code I write is to
          outsource responsibilities to machines, I believe this process brings
          convenience to people.
        </p>

        <p className={hubballiTypography.className}>
          As an experienced full-stack developer, I have been working with
          Reactjs, Nodejs, Nextjs, unit testing, test coverage, JavaScript, and
          TypeScript. I am always willing to learn new technologies like
          artificial intelligence. AI has been a subject of great interest to
          me, the idea of creating a program capable of autonomously solving
          problems is almost magical.
        </p>

        <p className={hubballiTypography.className}>
          I constantly seek to add value to my work, learn new tools, stay up on
          technology news and participate in developer communities.
