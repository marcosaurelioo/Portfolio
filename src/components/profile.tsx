        <p className={hubballiTypography.className}>
          A Software Enthusiast, I am a Brazilian self-taught Software Engineer
          who likes to create operational and attractive applications. Involved
          with computers since I was a child, I wrote my first algorithm when I
          was 16 years old, and since then I have been working on creating
          solutions with code. The motivation behind the code I write is to
          outsource responsibilities to machines, I believe this process brings
          convenience to people.
        </p>

        <p className={hubballiTypography.className}>
          Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of
          projects, from small-scale applications to large-scale enterprise
          systems. I developed experience in Nodejs, Nextjs, Reactjs, unit
          testing, test coverage, JavaScript, and TypeScript in agile
          environments. I am a team player who can work well under pressure,
          prioritize tasks and meet deadlines. I am willing to learn new
          technologies like artificial intelligence. AI has been a subject of
          great interest to me, the idea of creating a program capable of
          autonomously solving problems is almost magical.
        </p>

        <p className={hubballiTypography.className}>
          I constantly seek to add value to my work, learn new tools, stay up on
          technology news and participate in developer communities.
